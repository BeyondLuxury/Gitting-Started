# Gitting-Started
This guide will help you setup your Git Workflow on your machine, and will document how to setup a new site using our workflow. This guide assumes you are using WordPress as your backend.

## Prerequisites

This guide is split into four main sections:

 1. Local machine setup
 2. Server setup (...creating dev environment)
 3. Git Repository setup
 4. Wordpress database setup


## 1. Local machine setup
### Installing Necessary software & dependencies

Before you can get started with git you need to decide whether you'll work with git using the CLI (command line interface) or a GUI application. Either will work fine for our workflow. See below for setups for each:

#### CLI
The default terminal application that comes with OSX isn't great for what we need to do, so download and install [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/), an alternate terminal client which allows for a lot more customisation.

Next, we'll need zsh- an alternative to bash (which is the shell language that ships natively with OSX), again this will allow us to add visual elements to our terminal. to install zsh, we'll need [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) :
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
Once that's installed, restart iTerm2 and enter the following to install zsh:
```
brew install zsh zsh-completions
```

In iTerm2, run the following command to install oh-my-zsh:
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
To make zsh the default upon opening iTerm, run the following:
```
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

#### GUI Application

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
